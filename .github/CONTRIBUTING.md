# Contributing to the Jovo Framework

Thanks a lot for considering to contribute to Jovo ‚ù§Ô∏èüîä

Jovo is an open source framework that makes it easier for developers to build cross-platform voice apps.
Here is a very short set of guidelines to help you make Jovo better. Looking forward to your pull requests!

## Your First Contribution

We're looking for any kinds of contributions. If you need any inspiration, here are some things that might be interesting:

- Add integrations like Analytics and Databases
- Add platform specific features that haven't been added yet
- Propose new voice platforms

**Working on your first Pull Request?** You can learn how from this _free_ series [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github)
